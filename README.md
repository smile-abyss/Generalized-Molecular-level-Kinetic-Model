Simulating Polyethylene Pyrolysis from a Generalized Molecular-level Kinetic Model

A generalized molecular-level kinetic model was proposed to understand the pyrolysis of polyethylene applying structure-oriented lumping, Poisson distribution, and genetic algorithm. 

The number of ordinary differential equations derived from the reaction kinetics were dramatically reduced by this simplified network with 14-rule design.

The generalizability was confirmed by case studies without any change in the rule design.

Under most conditions, the mean relative error between experimental and model data could be controlled within 5%, while abnormal deviations indicate the obstacle of heat transfer. 

The simulation curve could provide guidance for the experiments by locating the peak value of products.
